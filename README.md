# Audio Pitch Detection Webapp
Created with Rust & wasm to create a module to detech pitch frequencies. If application does properly detect or run properly, try switching to Chrome.
The module for pitch detection is being written in Rust and compiled to wasm. Frontend is written using React and javascript to consume the generated wasm module.
